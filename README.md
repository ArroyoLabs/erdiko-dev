Vision
------

Erdiko wants to make your php development easier. If you need a lightweight MVC framework then this is the tool for you. Our goal is to offer a clean platform to create sites optimized for mobile devices, APIs and multiple browsers.

Erdiko can act as a mash-up or middleware framework too, hence the name 'Erdiko' which means 'middle' in the Basque language (Euskara). Use Erdiko if you need to mash-up multiple components, applications or even full frameworks. Combine things like Symfony Components, Drupal, Magento, WordPress, and Zend into a unified application.

Security Vulnerabilities
------------------------

If you discover any security vulnerabilities within Erdiko, please create a github issue and send an e-mail to John Arroyo at john@arroyolabs.com. Security is top concern and all vulnerabilities will be quickly addressed.

Notes
-----

We value feedback and would love to hear your thoughts about the architecture and ease of use of this framework.  There are a lot of possibilities for Erdiko, we value your ideas and thoughts about where to take this codebase.
